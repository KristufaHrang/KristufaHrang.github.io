Hey!
What are you doing here snooping around?
This is where my FinalProject for Programming is held,
If you want to download it here are some instructions to get it up and running

Firstly install the neccesary dependencies through pip install "x":
(Note: Some of these dependencies may have already been installed)

http
typing
unicodedata
urllib
requests
json
time
os
termcolor
win10toast
urlib3

Then simply click run.
If you need help, ask me then I'll give you the data you need to input to get it up and running
