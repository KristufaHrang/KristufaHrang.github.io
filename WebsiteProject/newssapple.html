			<strong>Apple introduced something out of the blue yesterday.</strong><br>
			After the pressure from the news about right to repair,
			Apple has introduced new ways for customers to fix their products<br>
			themselves with new unlocks in software and a new self-repair program offered.<br>
			<br>
		  This feature was initially released in the developer beta versions of iOS where users have found out that after changing non-genuine screens, the previously locked features of face-id were removed. Meaning Apple is finally giving into right to repair.<br>
		  <br>
		  Appl's right to repair movement has also been backed up by another program Apple is now offering named Self-Service Repair. This program allows customers to buy genuine apple components and repair their devices themselves. This program is initially being tested in America with other countries joining in 2022.<br><br>
		  <em>“Creating greater access to Apple genuine parts gives our customers even more choice if a repair is needed,”</em><br>- Jeff Williams, Apple chief operating officer.<br><br>
